# Frontend Standards (Next.js 15)

- **Server Components:** Prioritize React Server Components (RSC). Use `'use client'` only for interactive leaf components.
- **Tailwind:** Ensure the root `tailwind.config.js` uses `path.join` to include all workspace `libs` in its `content` array.
- **Strict Typing:** No `any`. Use `unknown` with Zod or Valibot for schema validation.
- **Optimizations:** Use `next/image` with WebP. 
- **pnpm specific:** If using a component library, ensure it is linked correctly via the pnpm workspace protocols.
