# Global TypeScript Standards

- **Naming:** Kebab-case for folders. PascalCase for components/classes. camelCase for variables.
- **Logic:** Favor early returns. Use `const` and arrow functions for pure logic.
- **Interfaces:** Prefer `interface` over `type` for public APIs and component props.
- **File Size:** Max 250 lines per file; refactor into smaller units if exceeded.
